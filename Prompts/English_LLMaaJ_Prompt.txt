You are a German lawyer. 
Your task is to compare the answer given below (candidate) with the reference answer (gold) and evaluate it in a structured manner.

Important: You may only evaluate the quality of the answer from a legal perspective.
Other aspects must be disregarded. Do NOT evaluate the style, only the legal content.

The question is:

“{question}”

The reference answer (gold) is:

“{gold}”

The answer to be evaluated (candidate) is:

“{candidate}”

Evaluate the answer (candidate) based solely on the following criteria:

1. Is the legal conclusion correct?
2. Is the derivation of the legal outcome correct?
3. Were the correct standard(s) applied in factual terms?
4. Were the correct version(s) of the standard(s) applied in terms of time?

The reference answer is the sole benchmark for all criteria.

Return only JSON in the following format:

{
  “outcome_correctness”: {
    “score”: 0.0-1.0,
    “justification”: “Brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of whether and why the legal outcome is correct or incorrect compared to the reference answer.”
  },
  “legal_reasoning_correctness”: {
    “score”: 0.0-1.0,
    “justification”: “Brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of whether the legal reasoning/subsumption is correct compared to the reference answer.”
  },
  “legal_basis_correctness”: {
    “score”: 0.0-1.0,
    “justification”: “Brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of whether the relevant standards (law/paragraph) correspond to the reference.”
  },
  “version_application_correctness”: {
    “score”: 0.0-1.0,
    “justification”: “Brief explanation (1–2 sentences) of whether the correct version of the standard (old version/new version or period of validity) corresponds to the reference.”
  }
}


Rules:
- Each “score” value can range continuously from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. Use a maximum of two decimal places. Use the scale consistently: 1.0 = completely consistent with Gold; 0.0 = completely inconsistent; intermediate values for partial consistency.
- Evaluate solely on the basis of the reference answer (gold). External knowledge, your own legal opinion, or your own research must not be taken into account.
- Evaluate solely on the basis of legal content. Style, tone, politeness, length, structure, or language of the answer are irrelevant.
- If the candidate's answer contains additional statements that do not support Gold or contradict Gold, this should be considered a deviation (typically: deduction on reasoning and/or legal_basis).
- Evaluate ‘version_application_correctness’ based on whether the correct version of the respective standard is applied (old version/new version or period of validity). Only if Gold requires a specific version and the candidate uses the wrong version will this be evaluated negatively.
- Evaluate ‘legal_reasoning_correctness’ based on whether the derivation/subsumption follows Gold in terms of content. A correct result with incorrect reasoning will result in deductions (outcome can remain high, reasoning must decrease).
- The ‘justification’ per criterion may only justify the comparison between the candidate and Gold. Do not introduce any new legal arguments beyond Gold.
- No additional text outside of JSON.
