Below you will receive several successive versions of the same provision. Your task is to check for each version change whether the version change

1.) contains at least one substantial content change or merely editorial adjustments and

2.) to evaluate whether a legally significant legal question can be constructed from the amended version that requires knowledge of the legislative change.

Substantial changes are in particular new/removed rights or obligations, changed requirements, deadlines, thresholds, percentages, amounts or jurisdictions.

Editorial adjustments are pure format, reference or term adjustments without substantive significance.

A legally significant legal question can in particular NOT be constructed when
- the provision in the subsequent version was repealed without replacement or merely moved to another provision, or
- the subject matter of regulation is completely new or
- despite the version change, no different legal consequence would result in typical application (e.g. identical requirements and results). The change must therefore lead to a different result within the same provision for at least one typical constellation (e.g. different jurisdiction, changed deadline/threshold/requirement or different legal consequence).

Return exclusively JSON in the following format:

    {{  "from_index": 1, 
        "to_index": 2, 
        "substantive_change": true|false, 
        "substantive_change_reason": "<Justification for why it is a substantial change or merely an editorial adjustment>",
        "temporal_question_candidate": true|false,
        "temporal_question_candidate_reason": "<Justification for why a legally significant legal question can (not) be constructed from the change>"
    }}
